[Scons](http://www.scons.org) Hierarchical Build Example
==================================================

A simple project showing how to build a C/C++ project with a realistic directory structure, including separate src/ and test/ and multiple levels of subdirectories.

Credit to [Raymond Penners](http://www.intenct.info/raymond.penners/2011/scons-build-better/) for the basic sconstruct file.

**2017 Edit: Scons has caused me nothing but pain. Use [Bazel](bazel). You can find an example in the [C++ code](https://github.com/dblalock/bolt/tree/master/cpp) for [Bolt](https://github.com/dblalock/bolt).**
